# ðŸ”Š NEXUS Cough Classification

This repository contains a training pipeline for a Cough classification model using Various Model. It supports audio augmentation via the [RIRS noise dataset](https://www.openslr.org/28/) for realistic room simulation.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Preparation
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Before training, ensure that the path to your dataset is correctly set in your config in the `config/lstm.json` folder:

```bash
"db_path": "/run/media/fourier/Data1/Pras/Database_ThesisNew/data/"
```
This folder must contain:

- somedatasets.csv: includes audiopath, labels
- audiodata folder: contains the actual audio files or processed data

```
/run/media/fourier/Data1/Pras/Database_ThesisNew/
â”œâ”€â”€ somedatasets.csv
â””â”€â”€ audiodata/
    â”œâ”€â”€ file1.wav
    â””â”€â”€ file2.wav
```
Update the path according to your environment before running the training script.


### 2. Train the Model

```bash
python ztrain_nonssl.py
```

Training logs will be saved to the ./logs/ directory. You can Check with this command:


```sh
tensorboard --logdir ./logs/lstm_try1
```
Open the provided [localhost](http://localhost:6006) link in your browser to monitor loss, accuracy, and other metrics during training.

After training is complete, please check the `logs` folder.

### Optional: Data Augmentation with RIRS

To apply room impulse response (RIR) augmentation:

Download the RIRS dataset from:
ðŸ‘‰ https://www.openslr.org/28/

Extract the contents and place them in a suitable path used by your config or augmentation script.
